# Titanic EDA Project

## Project Description
This project explores the Titanic dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to analyze the passenger data and extract meaningful insights. We visualize various trends and relationships using graphs.

## Files:
- **Titanic_EDA_Project.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that performs EDA on the Titanic dataset.
- **train.csv**: The Titanic dataset containing information about passengers.
- **Screenshots**: If you have any graphs or visual outputs, those can be added here.

## Steps Performed:
- Data Loading: Loaded the Titanic dataset and inspected the structure.
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, removed unnecessary columns, etc.
- Data Exploration: Analyzed correlations and visualized relationships using graphs.
- Insights: Summarized key findings.

## How to Run:
- Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
- Install the necessary packages using: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
- Open the `Titanic_EDA_Project.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code.

## Conclusion:
This analysis provides insights into which factors impacted the survival chances of passengers on the Titanic.
